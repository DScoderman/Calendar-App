# Calendar-App


## Description

The calendar app is to help workers plan out their workday, color coding events depending on when events are scheduled!
For making this app, I primarily used javascript and express feature dayJS to get the time and functionality working.

## Usage

Since there are no packages or other external items you need to download, begin by opening up the html site. Once opened, there will be rows representing the typical 9-5 workday. Click in the middle section of the rows to begin typing whatever you need. Once done, click the save icon on the right. Depending on the time of day, the calendar app will change color to reflect the status of the time: grey for in the past, red for the current hour, and green for the future. If you need to exit out, the app will save what you have previously written assuming you saved it!
